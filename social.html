		<h1>Social with Chinese</h1>
		<h2>Live streaming</h2>
		<p>
		Direct contact with the audience from mainland China through live
		streaming on the PandaTV network. Together with my friend Shao Zhang we are
		making shows about everyday life in the Netherlands. The audience can
		have a conversation with us during the recording. We only speak Chinese 100%.

		Rotterdam.

		<h2>Chinese Food Culture</h2>
		<p>
		One of the most delightfull aspects I have encountered while learning
		about China is it's food culture.
		No matter the occasion, whether it's discussing some business or visiting
		a friend's house, usually there will be food involved.

		<h2>Helping people to learn a new language</h2>
		<p>
		I love to help out other people. During my life in the Netherlands I have found the 
		opportunity to help other people in learning
		the Dutch language. At the same time all the people I have met are eager to introduce
		me to their own culture. Through this way I have learned a lot about
		foreign cultures and found some of the most
		valuable friendships in my life.
