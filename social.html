				<h2>Live streaming</h2>
				<p>
				Direct contact with the audience from mainland China through live
				streaming on the PandaTV network. Together with my friend Shao Zhang we are
				making shows about everyday life in the Netherlands. The audience can
				have a conversation with us during the recording. We only speak Chinese 100%.

				<h2>Chinese Food Culture</h2>
				<p>
				One of the most delightfull aspects I have encountered while learning
				about China is it's food culture.
				No matter the occasion, whether it's discussing some business or visiting
				a friend's house, usually there will be food involved.

				<h2>Helping people to learn a new language</h2>
				<p>
				I love to help out other people. During my life in the Netherlands I have found the 
				opportunity to help other people in learning
				the Dutch language. At the same time all the people I have met are eager to introduce
				me to their own culture. Through this way I have learned a lot about
				foreign cultures and found some of the most
				valuable friendships in my life.

				has passed all of his exams and he is now
				using the language be an active member of the Dutch society.
