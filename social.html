		<h1>Social Life with Chinese</h1>
		<h2>Guest appearences on PandaTV</h2>
		Direct contact with the audience from mainland China through instant video
		broadcasting on PandaTV. Together with the channel owner Shao Zhang we are
		making shows about everyday life in the Netherlands. The audience can ask us
		questions directly through instant chat. During the recording we speak 
		Chinese 100%.
		<h2>Dutch Integration Language Instructor</h2>
		For more than one year I have been helping Chinese people who are working or
		studying in the Netherlands passing their language exams Nederlands Niveau
		A2. During this period I had a lot of opportunity to practice my spoken
		Chinese and increase my international network.
