		<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
		<h2>Backend IT Technician with a passion for webdevelopment!</h2>
		<p>
		I love backend computersystems and webdevelopment. After a very long time of
		using Windows I found back my passion for computers by discovering the Linux
		Command Line. It's minimalist design, the directness of issueing commands on
		the command line, the preciseness of control is what makes me feel back in
		control of the computer again.
		</p>
		<p>
		After I have my Linux server up and running the thing I like to next is
		creating my own applications. In our present time every computer is
		connected through a network. After I have finished writing my own applications
		they are directly available to everyone through the world wide web. While
		the information displayed in my own application most likely is drawn from
		yet another source on the world wide web. While at the same time all the
		information is available to the user instantly and seamlessly. It is this
		very remarkable progress in information technology which brings my passion for 
		computers to a higher level.
