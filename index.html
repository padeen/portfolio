	<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
	<h2>Backend IT Technician with a passion for webdevelopment!</h2>
	<p>
	I love backend computersystems and webdevelopment. After a very long time of
	using Windows I found back my passion for computers by discovering the Linux
	Command Line. It's minimalist design, the directness of issueing commands on
	the command line, the preciseness of control is what makes me feel back in
	control of the computer again.

	<p>
	After I have my Linux server up and running the thing I like to next is
	creating my own applications. In our present time every computer is
	connected through a network. After I have finished writing my own applications
	they are directly available to everyone through the world wide web. While
	the information displayed in my own application most likely is drawn from
	yet another source on the world wide web. While at the same time all the
	information is available to the user instantly and seamlessly. It is this
	very remarkable progress in information technology which brings my passion for 
	computers to a higher level.
